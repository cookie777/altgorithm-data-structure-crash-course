There so many sort algorithm so far. More than 100!
These are one of the common algorithm. 
- Bubble
- Insertion
- Selection
- Merge
- Quick

The fastest way to understand is get hands on it!
Try to implement and assess its time and space complexity.
- What do you think is the best algorithm and why?
- Compare Merge sort VS Quick Sort. Pros and Cons?

## Exercise 02
What is the sort algorithm used for your familiar language?

## Exercise 03

- Pick up any favorite sort algorithm you like. (Excluding the list in above.)
- Any sort algorithm is ok! Even a stupid one!
