# Tree
## What
A tree is **Graph with no cycles**
    - Nodes : V
    - edges : V - 1

## Why
Tree usages
    - Hierarchical relationships
    - Manage sorted data
    - Enable fast searching operations

## Terms
- Root
- Parent
- Children
- Ancestor
- Descendent
- Siblings
- Leaf
- Depth
    - Height (max Depth)

## Type of trees
- Binary Tree
    - Variations [Different Types of Binary Tree with colourful illustrations](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-types-of-binary-tree-with-cool-illustrations-9b335c430254)
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Ternary Tree
- N-ary Tree


## How do we represent trees?
- 
- 

## Traversal Algorithm
- Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm


## Tree Traversal
### Achieved by DFS
- Pre-Order
    - 1st time you visit
    - "Root", Left, Right
- In-Order
    - 2nd time you visit
    - Left, "Root",  Right
- Post-Order
    - 3rd time you visit
    - Left,  Right,  "Root"
